## Hi there :3
![Top langs](https://github-readme-stats-git-masterrstaa-rickstaa.vercel.app/api?username=usarana&&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

My name is Mitko and I'm from Bulgaria. I love C#, it's the language I started coding in

I also code in Rust, Go, C, C++, Python, Svelte, HTML, CSS and TS

I'm the person who started Sova (also Sova Software), a small team with the goal of making people's lives easier

I like cars (BMW ftw) and I used to play chess. I like breaking Windows, as you can see on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@itsmitko)

You can contact me on:
- Telegram: @MitkoYT
- Discord: @mitkoyt
- Twitter: @MitkoYT7
- Reddit: u/mitkoyt
- Email: admin@sovasoftware.net (I probably won't see it)
